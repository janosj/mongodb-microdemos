# Microdemos

A collection of frequently-used "micro demos" - very quick demos that can interjected into slide decks or conversations to illustrate a concept.

Note: if you're looking for the simple Node.js web form application, it's been moved to a separate repo (<https://github.com/janosj/mongodb-web-app>).
