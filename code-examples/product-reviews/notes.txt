This code is designed to accompany a Tech 101 presentation
that illustrates the concept of referencing. 

It consists of 2 collections: PRODUCTS and REVIEWS.
The PRODUCTS collection is designed to incude the last 10 reviews.
The REVIEWS collection is therefore seldom needed.

A PRODUCT might look like this:
{ 
  _id : ObjectId('x74prjjjjjjjL2'),
  name : 'bar stool', 
  manufacturer : 'Acme Corp',
  color: 'brown',  
  last_10_reviews: [ 	 // array with references
    { 
      review_ID: ObjectID('Ae54jxxxxx7ti'),
      // display info
      user_id: 'sallymoe2', 
      display_text: 'I really loved this bar stool…'
    }
    …
  ]
}

A REVIEW might look like this:
{ 
  _id : ObjectId('Ae54jxxxxx7ti'), 
  user_id: 'sallymoe2', 
  display_text: 'I really loved …',
  full_text: 'I really loved this bar stool. Had my doubts but it looks great.'
}

"insert-product.mql" can be executed within the Mongo shell:
load("1-insert-product.mql")

Reviews can be added one by one using the add-review.mql script.
Hand edits may be necessary to discern between multiple reviews.
